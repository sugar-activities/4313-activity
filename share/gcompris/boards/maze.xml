At the first levels, Tux walks comfortably, one step on each keypress, through the labyrinth.

For larger labyrinths, there is a special walking mode, called "run-fast-mode". If this run-fast-mode is enabled, Tux will run all the way automatically until he reaches a fork and you have to decide which way to go further.

You can see whether this mode is enabled or not, by looking at Tux's feet: If Tux is barefooted, "run-fast-mode" is disabled. And if he wears red sport shoes, "run-fast-mode" is enabled.

From level 14 on, run-fast-mode will be enabled automatically. If you want to use this feature in earlier levels or want to disable it in advanced levels, click on Tux or the "barefoot / sportshoe"-icon in the upper left corner of the screen to toggle the run-fast-mode.
